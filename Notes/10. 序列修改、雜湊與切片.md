# Outline
0. Extra: Understanding duck typing, EAFP
1. Understanding types of sequences in python
2. Hacking sequences to achieve a desired outcome
3. The use of slicing to extract parts of a sequence
4. The concept of hashing and hash tables
5. The built-in hash function and its use in hashing sequences

# Duck Typing
> "Duck Typing" is a concept in dynamic programming languages, where the type of an object is determined by the methods and properties it has, rather than the class it belongs to. The phrase is based on the saying "If it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck". In Python, this means that if an object has the necessary methods and properties, it can be used as if it were an instance of a particular class, even if it is actually an instance of a completely different class.

## Conclusion
- As long as an object has the methods and properties that you need, you can use it as if it were an instance of a specific class.

## Example: duck typing
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b


result = add(1, 2) 
# returns 3

result = add("Hello, ", "world") 
# returns "Hello, world"

```

- Here, the `add` function only cares about the '+' operator being defined for the objects passed in.

```python
class Adder:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
    
    def __add__(self, b):
        return self.a + b

result = add(Adder(1), 2) # returns 3, even though Adder is not a type of int
```
- In this example, we've created a custom `Adder` class with a `__add__` method. This allows instances of the `Adder` class to be used with the `+` operator, just like integers. 
- When we pass an instance of `Adder` to the `add` function, it works just like it would with an integer, even though the class is completely different.

# EAFP
> "Easier to ask forgiveness than permission" (EAFP) is a coding philosophy that encourages you to assume that things are valid until an exception is raised, rather than checking for validity beforehand. This is often more concise, faster, and easier to read than using explicit if-statements to validate input. In Python, this is achieved by using exceptions to control the flow of execution. For example, instead of checking if a key exists in a dictionary before trying to access it, you can simply use a try/except block to catch the KeyError exception that will be raised if the key does not exist.

## Conclusion
- Instead of using `if, else` statement â†’ use `try, except` keyword logic

## Example: EAFP
```python
# complete person
person = {'name': 'Jess', 'age': 23, 'job': 'Programmer'}
# un-complete person
person = {'name': 'Jess', 'age': 23}

# EAFP way (Pythonic)
try:
    print("I'm {name}. I'm {age} years old and I am a {job}.".format(**person))
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"Missing {e} key")

# Non-Pythonic way
if 'name' in person and 'age' in person and 'job' in person:
	print("I'm {name}. I'm {age} years old and I am a {job}.".format(**person))
else:
	print("Missing some keys")

```

```bash
# for complete person
I'm Jess. I'm 23 years old and I am a Programmer. 

# for un-complete person
Missing 'job' key # pythonic way
Missing some keys # non-pythonic way
```

# Types of Sequences in Python
- Brief overview of sequences in Python and the different types of sequences available.

## List
```python
shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "oranges", "carrots"]
```
- Key features:
	- Ordered: Elements in a list have a specific order
	- Mutable: Lists can be modified after creation
	- Can hold elements of different types

## Tuples
```python
coordinates = (10, 20, 30)
```

- Key features:
    - Ordered: Elements in a tuple have a specific order
    - Immutable: Tuples cannot be modified after creation
    - Can hold elements of different types


## Strings
```python
name = "John Doe"
```

- Key features:
	- Ordered: Characters in a string have a specific order
	- Immutable: Strings cannot be modified after creation
	- Can only hold characters

## Sum
- The sequence types in python:
	- List: ordered, mutable, hold different types elements
	- Tuple: ordered, *immutable*, hold different types elements
	- Strings: ordered, *immutable*, hold ONLY characters

# Hacking Sequences
- Brief overview of the topic and the different techniques for hacking sequences.

## Concatenation
```python
fruits = ["apples", "bananas"]
vegetables = ["carrots", "broccoli"]
shopping_list = fruits + vegetables
```

```python
shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "carrots", "broccoli"]
```

## Repetition
```python
fruits = ["apples", "bananas"]
shopping_list = fruits * 3
```

```python
shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "apples", "bananas", "apples", "bananas"]
```
## Slicing
```python
shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "carrots", "broccoli"]
selected_items = shopping_list[1:3]
```

```python
selected_items = ["bananas", "carrots"]
```

## Summary
- Hacking sequences key points:
	- concatenation
	- repetition
	- slicing

# Use of slicing
- Brief overview of slicing and its use in modifying parts of a sequence.

## Extract parts of sequence
```python
shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "carrots", "broccoli"]
selected_items = shopping_list[1:3]
```
```python
selected_items = ["bananas", "carrots"]
```

## Modifying parts of sequence
```python
shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "carrots", "broccoli"]
shopping_list[1:3] = ["cherries", "grapes"]
```
```python
shopping_list = ["apples", "cherries", "grapes", "broccoli"]
```

## Summary
- Discuss the various applications of slicing in Python, such as:
    -   Extracting parts of a string
    -   Extracting parts of a list
    -   Modifying parts of a string or list

# Hashing & Hash Tables
- Brief overview of hashing and hash tables and their use in storing and retrieving data.

## Hashing explain
- "Hashing" is the process of converting a value into a **`numerical representation`**, called a **"hash value"**, that can be used for **efficient indexing in a hash table**. 

## Hash table explain
- A hash table is a **data structure** that allows for **constant-time lookups and updates, making it a common choice** for implementing dictionaries and other similar data structures.

## Implementation
```python
phone_book = {}
phone_book["John Doe"] = "555-555-5555"
phone_book["Jane Doe"] = "555-555-5556"
```

```python
phone_book = {"John Doe": "555-555-5555", "Jane Doe": "555-555-5556"}
```

## Summary
- Advantages of hash tables: Discuss the advantages of hash tables, such as:
    - Fast lookup time
    - Efficient storage
    - Easy to implement

# Hash function
- Brief overview of the built-in hash function in Python and its use in hashing sequences.

## Hash function explain
- A hash function is used to **perform the hashing of a value**. A good hash function has the **property that it maps values to a unique hash value** in a uniform way, so that values that are "close" in some sense will be unlikely to map to the same hash value. 
- The hash value is then **used as an index** into the hash table, where the actual value can be stored and retrieved.

## Implementation
```python
hash("hello world") # Output: 1610137733747057673
```

## Limitations
- Hash value are unique but not stable
- Hash values for mutable objects cannot be changed
- Some objects are not hashable

### Unique but not stable
```python
a = (1, 2, 3)
b = (1, 2, 3)
print(hash(a))
print(hash(b))
```

```python
2528502973977326415
2528502973977326415
```

### for mutable objects cannot be changed
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
print(hash(a))
a.append(4)
print(hash(a))
```

```python
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

### Some object are not hashable
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
hash(a)
hash(b)
```

```python
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

## Summary
- Key points of the built-in hash function in Python
- limitations of hashing sequences

# Applications of hashing and slicing
- real-world applications of hashing and slicing, including data processing and analysis

## Small review
- **Slicing** can be used to extract a specific range of data from a dataset, such as the last 10 rows of a spreadsheet.
- **Hashing** can be used to index data in a large dataset, allowing for faster search and retrieval.

## Slicing example
```python
# Slicing example:
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
recent_data = data[-10:]
print(recent_data) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

## Hashing example
```python
# Hashing example:
data = {hash(str(x)): x for x in range(10)}
print(data)
print('===')
print(data[hash(str(5))]) # 5
```

```python
{
	6347739193637901306: 0, 
	810320619120594221: 1,
