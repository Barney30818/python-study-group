# Introduction
## Decorators intro
- Powerful **"feature"** in Python 
- Allow you to **modify or extend the behavior of functions and methods**. 
- They are defined using the **def keyword**, and are applied to a function using the **@decorator** syntax. 
- Decorators are often used to add functionality, such as logging or caching, to a function **without modifying its source code**.
## Closures intro
- A **"way"** to capture state from the enclosing scope within a function.
- Allow you to define a function that **"remembers" the values** of variables **in the scope where it was defined**, even after that scope has completed execution. 
- Closures can be used in **conjunction with decorators to create stateful decorators** that retain state across multiple function calls.
## Sum: Decorators + Closures 
- reusable
- modular
- maintainable 

# Decorators explain
- Basic concept of decorators 
- *Example*: 
	- how it is applied to a function using the **@decorator** syntax
	- **modify or extend the behavior** of functions and methods 

## Decorators basic concept
- The basic concept of a decorator in Python is a function that **takes another function as an argument**, performs some **operations on that function**, and then returns the original function. The returned function is then assigned to the original function's name, effectively replacing it
## Example: syntax & extend behavior
-   In this example, the **`log_decorator`** function takes a function as an argument and returns a new function **`wrapper`** that has the **desired logging behavior**. 
- The **`wrapper`** function calls the original function and **prints the arguments and return value**.
-  When we apply the **`log_decorator`** to the **`add`** function using the **`@log_decorator`** syntax, it effectively replaces the **`add`** function with the **`wrapper`** function. When we call the **`add(1, 2)`** the output will be:

### Eample: decorator syntax, extend logging behavior
```python
def log_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f'Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}')
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f'{func.__name__} returned: {result}')
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_decorator
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(1, 2)
```

```Bash
Calling add with args: (1, 2), kwargs: {}
add returned: 3
```
## Sum
- Above example show how decorators can be used to **modify or extend the behavior of a function** without changing its source code. 
- Decorators can also be used to add functionality like **caching, authentication, or performance monitoring**.
- Decorators **can be chained together**, meaning you can apply **multiple decorators to a single function**, allowing you to add multiple functionalities to the function.

# Closures
- Basic concept of closures 
- How closure **capture state** from the enclosing scope
- *Example*: 
	- How it can be **used as a decorator to retain state** across multiple function calls
## Closure basic concept
- A closure is a **function object** that has **access to variables in its enclosing scope**, even when the function is invoked outside that scope. 
- In Python, closures are **created when a nested function references a variable from its enclosing function**.

### Example: How closure capture state

```python
def outer(x):
    def inner():
        print(x)
    return inner

closure = outer(10)
closure()  # Output: 10
```

- The **`outer`** function defines and returns the nested **`inner`** function. The **`inner`** function references the **`x`** variable from its enclosing scope, so it captures the state of that variable.
- When we call **`outer(10)`**, it returns the inner function which is stored in the **`closure`** variable. Then we call **`closure()`**, it will print the value of x which is 10.
-  To sum up, example demonstrates **how a closure captures the state of a variable from its enclosing scope.** 
- This allows you to **define a function that "remembers" the values of variables** in the scope where it was defined, even after that scope has completed execution. 
- This is **useful when you want to retain state across multiple function calls**.
- Closures can also be used to **implement decorators that retain state across multiple function** calls by enclosing a function that maintains state and returning it as a closure.

### Example: decorator + closure
> **retain state** across multiple function calls
```python
def counter_decorator(func):
    count = 0

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        print(f'{func.__name__} has been called {count} times')
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    
    return wrapper

@counter_decorator
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(1, 2)
add(2, 3)
add(3, 4)
```
```bash
add has been called 1 times
add has been called 2 times
add has been called 3 times
```
- Explain
  - In this example, the **`counter_decorator`** function defines a closure that captures the state of the **`count`** variable from its enclosing scope. The closure is returned by the decorator and is applied to the **`add`** function using the **`@counter_decorator`** syntax.
  - In this example, the closure **`wrapper`** retains the state of the **`count`** variable across multiple function calls, allowing us to keep track of how many times the **`add`** function has been called.

## Sum
- Closure is a **way** to capture state from the enclosing scope within a function.
- Closures can be used in **conjunction with decorators to create stateful decorators that retain state** across multiple function calls.
- Closure can be used to **maintain state of any variables**, such as a cache or a counter, that needs to be retained across multiple function calls.

# Advanced Techniques
- Discuss advanced decorator techniques such as **preserving function metadata** and **chaining decorators together** 

## Explain - preserving metadata
- In Python, **functions have metadata** associated with them, such as the **`name`**, **`docstring`**, and **`annotations`**.
- Preserving function metadata by using the **`functools.wraps`** decorator, which is **a decorator for updating the attributes of a wrapped function to those of the original function**.

### Example: Preserving function metadata

```python
import functools

def my_decorator(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # do something before
        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # do something after
        return result
    return wrapper

def my_clean_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # do something before
        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # do something after
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def add(a, b):
    """
    This function adds two numbers together with wraps.
    """
    return a + b

@my_clean_decorator
def addClean(a, b):
    """
    This function adds two numbers together with clean decorator.
    """
    return a + b

print(add.__name__) 
print(add.__doc__)  
print("===")
print(addClean.__name__) 
print(addClean.__doc__)
```
```bash
add
This function adds two numbers together with wraps.
===
wrapper
None
```
- Explain - chaining decorators
  - applying **multiple decorators to a single function**, in a specific order.
  - The **order in which decorators are applied** to a function can be important because each decorator may modify the behavior of the function in a different way.
  - **`innermost`** decorator run FIRST.
### Example: Chaining decorators together
```python
def decorator1(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # do something before
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("exec @dec 1")
        # do something after
        return result
    return wrapper

def decorator2(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # do something before
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("exec @dec 2")
        # do something after
        return result
    return wrapper

@decorator1
@decorator2
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(2, 3))
```
```bash
exec @dec 2
exec @dec 1
5
```

## Sum
- *Example 1*: 
	- **preserving function's metadata** with using **`functools.wraps`** to preserve the original function's metadata.
- *Example 2*: 
	- applying **multiple decorators** to a single function, **`innermost`** decorator run FIRST.

# Best Practices (Review)
- Decorators and closures are powerful features in Python that can be used to **modify or extend the behavior of functions and methods**. 
- Here are some **best practice & tips** for writing clear and maintainable code using decorators and closures.

### Example 1: extanding original function behavior without modify source code
```python
def log_call(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with {args} and {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_call
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(2, 3)
# Calling add with (2, 3) and {}
# add returned 5
```
1.  Use decorators to **separate cross-cutting concerns from the main logic** of a function. Decorators can be used to add functionality such as logging, caching, and validation, without cluttering the main logic of a function.

### Example 2: capture state using closure
```python
def counter():
    count = 0
    def inner():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return inner

counter1 = counter()
print(counter1()) # 1
print(counter1()) # 2

counter2 = counter()
print(counter2()) # 1
```
2.  Use **closures to capture state** from the enclosing scope. Closures can be used to create decorators that retain state across multiple function calls.

### Example 3: decorator with preserving functino metadata
```python
import functools
def my_decorator(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # do something before
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # do something after
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def add(a, b):
    """This function adds two numbers together."""
    return a + b

print(add.__name__) # add
print(add.__doc__) # This function adds two numbers together.
```
3.  Use **`functools.wraps`** to **preserve function metadata** when decorating a function. This will keep the original name, docstring, and other attributes of the function.

### Example 4: chaining decorators
```python
def decorator1(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # do something before
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # do something after
        return result
    return wrapper

def decorator2(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # do something before
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # do something after
        return result
    return wrapper

@decorator1
@decorator2
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
4. Use **chaining decorators to apply multiple decorators** to a single function in a specific order. Keep in mind that the **innermost decorator runs first**, and the outermost decorator runs last.

## Sum up
- To write clear and maintainable code, it's essential to keep your decorators and closures **simple and focused on a single concern**. 
- You should also **document your decorators and closures thoroughly**, so that other developers can understand how to use them.
